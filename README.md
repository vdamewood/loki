# Loki

Loki is a repository I use for the generally usable parts of my
personal Django-based web site. I don't put any effort into packaging it
for general use. There are three components to Loki: Loki Core, Loki
Blog, and Loki Software. Loki Core includes code useful across the other
components, Loki Blog is a blog backend, and Loki Software is an
application for managing my software portfolio. Loki is licensed under
the Apache License, version 2.0.
