# Tuli

Tuil is a repository I use for the generally usable parts of my
personal Django-based web site. I don't put any effort into packaging it
for general use. There are three components to Tuli: Tuli Core, Tuli
Blog, and Tuli Software Catalog. Tuli is licensed under the terms of the
Apache License 2.0.

## Tuli Core
Tuli Core includes a custom field for page content with custom tags.
It allows for responsive images to be included in page content and for
links to be included between Tuli components without using raw URLs.

## Tuli Blog

Tuli Blob is a simple blog. It included support for a single, unnamed
author, and tags. I plan on adding more features in the future.

## Tuli Software Catalog

Tuli software catalog is an application for managing my software
portfolio. It supports showing a single project page at the moment, but
I intend to add download archive and documentation support in the
future.
