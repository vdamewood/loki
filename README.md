# Loki

Loki is a repository I use for the generally usable parts of my
person, Django-based web site. Because Loki is made for my personal
web site, I don't put any effort into packaging it for general use.
Loki consists of three components: Loki Core, Loki Blog, and
Loki Software. Core includes code useful across the other components,
Loki Blog is a blog backend, and Loki Software is an application for
managing a software portfolio. Loki is licensed under the Apache
License, version 2.0.
